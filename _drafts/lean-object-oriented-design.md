# Lean Object-Oriented Design

The principles of Lean software development and their influence on object
oriented design.

## Agile

[Launch Academy Blog - Product Development Lifecycle]

## [Lean Software Development][Wikipedia - Lean Software Development]

## [The Lean Principles][Wikipedia - Lean Principles]

### [Eliminate waste][Wikipedia - Lean Eliminate Waste]

> The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that arenâ€™t
> there. [^1]  
[Gordon Bell][Wikipedia - Gordon Bell]

> I was joking the other week that we should have somebody whose job it is to
> follow every project and get notified of every pull request and just go into
> the thread and ask "Do you really need to do this?" You need that constant
> voice. [^4]  
[Joe Ferris - CTO at Thoughbot][Thoughtbot - Joe Ferris]

[DRY][Wikipedia - DRY]
[KISS][Wikipedia - KISS]
[YAGNI][Wikipedia - YAGNI]
[TDD][Wikipedia - TDD]

Lots you can do to help facilitate future change:

[SOLID][Wikipedia - SOLID]

Minimize coupling

[Creator][Wikipedia - GRASP - Creator][Wikipedia - GRASP - Creator]
[Loose Coupling][Wikipedia - Loose Coupling]
[Dependency Injection][Wikipedia - Dependency Injection]
[Dependency Inversion Principle][Wikipedia - Dependency Inversion Principle]

### [Amplify learning][Wikipedia - Lean Amplify Learning]

> Short feedback loops give us confidence. Confidence leads to enjoyment. I love
> driving my donkeys, and I love working on a software development team that is
> guided by continual quick feedback! Look how much fun this is! [^2]  
[Lisa Crispin - Agile Testing Coach and Practitioner][Lisa Crispin]

> Design is a process of progressive discovery that relies on a feedback loop.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

[Test-driven Development][Wikipedia - TDD] Provides feedback not just on when
things are broken, but on the quality of the design of your objects.
[Fail fast; learn rapidly][Lean Software Development - Fail Fast]

frequent client interactions, developer to customer interactions.
stand up

### [Decide as late as possible][Wikipedia - Lean Decide Late]

Prefer responding to change over following a plan.
[The Agile Manifesto][Wikipedia - Agile - Agile Manifesto]

> Any decision you make in advance of an explicit requirement is just a guess.
> Don't decide; preserve your ability to make a decision later. [^3]  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

> The more complex a system is, the more the capacity for change should be built
> into it.  
[Decide as late as possible][Wikipedia - Lean Decide Late]

> "What is the future cost of doing nothing today?"
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

> When the future cost of doing nothing is the same as the current cost, postpone
> the decision. Make the decision only when you must with the information you have
> available at that time.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

[DRY][Wikipedia - DRY]
[YAGNI][Wikipedia - YAGNI]

### [Deliver as fast as possible][Wikipedia - Lean Deliver Fast]

> Design is more the art of preserving changeability than it is the act of
> achieving perfection.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

> It's just so easy and fun to build a lot of software. Fixing bugs or spending
> a lot of time to figure out what is wrong and then tweaking the code to fix
> it, that's just not as fun as writing a lot of software. As developers who are
> excited about software, we're always tempted to do this. [^4]  
[Joe Ferris - CTO at Thoughbot][Thoughtbot - Joe Ferris]

[YAGNI][Wikipedia - YAGNI]
[KISS][Wikipedia - KISS]

[Test-driven Development][Wikipedia - TDD] helps minimize feedback loop so it's
easier to track down where a bug was introduced.

Build for change.

### [Empower the team][Wikipedia - Lean Empower The Team]

> Find good people and let them do their own job.  
[Wikipedia - Lean Empower The Team][Wikipedia - Lean Empower The Team]

> You don't send messages because you have objects, you have objects because you
> send messages.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

> When design is dictated from afar none of the necessary adjustments can occur
and early failures of understanding get cemented into the code.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

Applies to real teams, and also objects. Find the right object and let it do
it's job.

[Single Responsibility Principle][Wikipedia - SRP]
[SOLID][Wikipedia - SOLID]
[GRASP][Wikipedia - GRASP]
[High Cohesion][Wikipedia - GRASP - High Cohesion]

[MINASWAN][Wikipedia - MINASWAN]

### [Build quality in][Wikipedia - Lean Build Quality In]

> Conceptual integrity means that the system's separate components work together
> as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and
> responsiveness.  
[Wikipedia - Build Quality In][Wikipedia - Lean Build Quality In]

> Repetitions in the code are signs of bad code design and should be avoided.  
[Wikipedia - Build Quality In][Wikipedia - Lean Build Quality In]

> Depend on things that change less often than you do.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

[DRY][Wikipedia - DRY]
[Refactoring]][Refactoring]
[TDD][Wikipedia - TDD] Again, feedback provided by TDD gives
you more immediate feedback on the quality of the design you have implemented.
[Pair programming][Wikipedia - Pair Programming]

### [See the whole][Wikipedia - Lean See The Whole]

> By decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks ... the root cause of defects
> should be found and eliminated.  
[Wikipedia - See The Whole][Wikipedia - Lean See The Whole]

> The larger the system, the more organizations that are involved in its
> development and the more parts are developed by different teams, the greater the
> importance of having well defined relationships between different vendors, in
> order to produce a system with smoothly interacting components.  
[Wikipedia - See The Whole][Wikipedia - Lean See The Whole]

> Using dependency injection to shape code relies on your ability to recognize
> that the responsibility for knowing the name of a message to send to that
> class may belong to different objects.  
[Sandi Metz][SandiMetz] from [Practical Object-Oriented Development in Ruby][Amazon - POODR]

> Which class is responsible for creating objects is a fundamental property of
> the relationship between objects of particular classes.  
[General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP)][Wikipedia - GRASP]

[TDD][Wikipedia - TDD] Helps encourage a larger perspective by ensuring that all
objects have to interacting with at least one other class.
