  bio: "Hello there! I'm a senior software engineer at Datto in Boston, MA where I lead the platform team against the ever looming threat of technical debt and decay. With more than 5 years of experience with Ruby, Rails, and related technologies, I have a passion for the web and open source software. A self-proclaimed Ruby champion and developer advocate, when I'm not coding, I can be found scheming of ways I could be coding or trying to convince myself that other hobbies are a good idea."
